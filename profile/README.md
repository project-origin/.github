# Project-Origin
<!--
The mission of the project in as a concise format as possible. It should answer what the project's purpose is and enable contributors to make a good first guess whether a suggested feature will likely be in scope for the project, or not.
-->

Project-Origin is an open source collaboration that aims to create a public permissioned distributed ledger where everyone can validate the origin of their electricity. The long-term goal is to create the domain-specific framework in a way that allows easy adoption in other industries. By being able to do so, we can create value in a broader scope, and support and accelerate the green transition. By creating an open source platform for collaboration, we can pool ressources and accelerate the development of critical digital infrastructure. 

While developing the necessary digital infrastructure, we additionally work to set up this source platform with decision- and work structures, to achieve effective asynchronous collaboration through transparent, accessible software, and by using decision-making processes driven by _doing_.

## Ongoing Implementation Efforts 
There is currently an implementation effort working on creating the first version of a federated, publicly verifiable registry. Go to the [Registry repository](https://github.com/project-origin/registry) to learn more about the implementation details and project status.
