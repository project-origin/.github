# Project-Origin

Project-Origin is an open source collaboration that aims to create a public federated network where everyone can validate the origin of their electricity.
The long-term goal is to create the domain-specific framework in a way that allows easy adoption in other industries.
By being able to do so, we can create value in a broader scope, and support and accelerate the green transition.
By creating an open source platform for collaboration, we can pool resources and accelerate the development of critical digital infrastructure.

While developing the necessary digital infrastructure, we additionally work to set up this source platform with decision- and work structures, to achieve effective asynchronous collaboration through transparent, accessible software, and by using decision-making processes driven by _doing_.

## Ongoing Implementation Efforts
