# Project-Origin

<!--
The mission of the project in as a concise format as possible. It should answer what the project's purpose is and enable contributors to make a good first guess whether a suggested feature will likely be in scope for the project, or not.
-->

Project-Origin is an open source collaboration that aims to create a public permissioned distributed ledger where everyone can validate the Guarantee of Origin for their electricity. The long-term goal is to expand the scope from electricity, to include other utilities. 

The project is created as open source, as we believe that joint collaboration in a structured, open source space enables faster, more secure, and higher-quality solutions. The goal is to facilitate asynchronous collaboration, decision-making processes driven by \emph{doing}, and through transparent, accessible, and open software. 

## Ongoing Collaboration efforts 
Currently, there is an ongoing implementation effort revolving around creating the first version of a **Federated Publicly Verifiable Registry**. Go to the [Registry repository](https://github.com/project-origin/registry) to learn more about the status and progress of this development project. 

## Getting Involved
