# Project-Origin

<!--
The mission of the project in as a concise format as possible. It should answer what the project's purpose is and enable contributors to make a good first guess whether a suggested feature will likely be in scope for the project, or not.
-->

Project-Origin is an open source experiment consisting of two parallel tracks: 
1) A software development track evolving around creating solutions to enable publicly verifiable proofs for tracking of Energy 
2) A collaboration platform development track, with the long-term goal of constructing a cross-sector collaboration platform for creating standardized digital infrastructure in the supply industry.

The two tracks are tied together through ongoing collaboration efforts.

Digitalization creates the opportunity for new data-based solutions and business models, contributing to optimize the use of physical infrastructure. Optimizing the use of ressources can help accelerate the green transition within the supply indsustry, and hence we find that developing digital infrastructure is critical and urgent. To get there, we believe that working in a structured collaboration space, using open source practices, enables faster, more coherent, and higher-quality solutions, than if the currently non-existing infrastructure is developed individually. The goal is to facilitate asynchronous collaboration, decision-making processes driven by \emph{doing}, and through transparent, accessible, and open software. 

## Ongoing Collaboration efforts 
Currently, there is an ongoing collaboration effort revolving around creating solutions that enable publicly verifiable proofs for the origin of produced energy. The first functionality to be developed in this context is to create the first version of a **Federated Publicly Verifiable Registry**. Go to the [Registry repository]() to learn more about the status and progress of this development project.

I am thinking: Move this part to the Readme in the Registry project 
## Registry

The goal of [this project](https://github.com/orgs/project-origin/projects/1) is to create the first version of a **Federated Publicly Verifiable Registry**

The registry will enable the following:

- [ ] Federation setup enabling multiple registries to create a common truth.
- [ ] Enable the issuance of Granular Certificates.
- [ ] Enable the claim of Granular Certificates to some consumption.
- [ ] The registry handles ownership based on public-private key-pairs.
- [ ] Users can verify that they have a proffable amount of a Granular Certificate, that mathematically proves it is only used once.
- [ ] Users can transfer ownership of a sub-part of a certificate to another private-key.
- [ ] Privacy of the individual measurement is hidden behind a Petersen-commitments.

## Getting Involved

<!--
- A "Getting involved" section that explains which public, archived, linkable communication channels the project uses. This should include a link to the project issue tracker, but also to any further discussion media used.
-->

If you want to get involved in the project with us, the first important step is to make yourself familiar with our work- and decision structures. To do that, we have made a guide on [How to Start Collaborating with Us](www.deadlink) for you. Further, you can take a look at our [Discussion Channels](https://github.com/orgs/project-origin/discussions), to obtain an overview of the project's current status and progress.

- Documentation on how to contribute to the overall collaboration project - or a link to that.

## Who Are We?
<!--
- A "Who we are" section explaining who the Trusted Committers behind the project are - with an explanation that instead of contacting these people privately the public communication channels above should be used for communication.
