🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
-->
Project-Origin is an open source collaboration platform, that facilitates joint implementation efforts to obtain verifiable, secure and traceable digital documentation connected to a given product. This documentation could, for example, include time of production, production- or transportation related emissions, location of production or other details that might be of interest to the consumer. 

With Project-Origin our long-term goal is to create a platform that facilitates working-groups collaborating across sectors and countries, to obtain shared ownership of a fundamental digital infrastructure for traceable product documentation. Project-Origin uses open source practices and processes to structure the collaboration efforts, in order to enable a much faster and more efficient development and implementation process, than if the currently non-existing functionalities needed to obtain the digital documentation were developed individually.

## Open Source Practices for Decision-Making 
TODO: Write some summarizing details about open source practices and work structures.

## Ongoing Project Collaborations
The [Registry Project](https://github.com/project-origin/registry) is an implementation collaboration, working on creating a federated publicly verifiable registry, which enables issuance of and mathematically provable one-time claiming of [Granular Certificates](https://energytrackandtrace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ETT-Architectural-Specification.pdf).
